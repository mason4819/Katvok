# What is Katvok? 🐢

Katvok is a transparent desktop overlay application that renders floating images across your screen with smooth, space-like motion.

Running silently above all windows, Katvok creates an ambient visual layer without blocking mouse or keyboard interaction, allowing you to continue using your system normally while enjoying subtle animated effects.

Designed for stability and low resource usage, Katvok is ideal for desktop customization, display machines, presentations, and creative visual setups.
